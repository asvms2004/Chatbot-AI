## Setting Up a GitHub Repository

    ```bash
    git init
    ```
2.  **Stage your files:** Add all the project files to the staging area.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
3.  **Make your first commit:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Create AI chatbot application"
    ```
4.  **Create a new repository on GitHub:** Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and create a new, empty repository. Do not initialize it with a README or .gitignore.
5.  **Link your local repository to GitHub:** Copy the commands from GitHub. They will look like this (replace the URL with your own):
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
6.  **Push your code to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

Your code is now saved on GitHub!
